# SGF.js

SGF.js is a Go/Baduk/Weiqi game viewer for use in blogs, forums, etc.  It
automatically finds go game records on the page and replaces it with an
interactive player.  We've designed the player to be completely responsive
and fully skinable.

## Basic usage

Simply link the library and stylesheet from your page.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="sgf.css">
<script src="sgf.js"></script>
```
